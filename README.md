Welcome to the Github repository of our Comhelp app !

Comhelp is a free classified-ad website where you can ask other users for help, guidance and various types of things based on categories.

All you need to post an classified-ad is to sign up. After signup, you receive an email to confirm your registration. From your personal account page, you can update your information, get a listing of post you’ve created and answered and post a new classified-ad.

As soon as an ad is submitted and validated by an admin, will be visible on the landing page. Any registered user is then allowed to click a button to answer a post. 
For each new classified-ad validated a tweet is made on our twitter account

The original poster of the classified-ad still has a right to reject your proposal.
