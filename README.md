Welcome to the Github repository of our Comhelp app !

Comhelp is a free classified-ad website where you can ask other users for help, guidance and various types of things based on categories.

All you need to post an ad is to sign up. after signup, users get an email and. From your personal account page you can update your info, get a listing of ads you’ve created and answered and post a new ad.

As soon as an ad is submitted and validated (we can’t just let anyone post anything), it shows on the app’s landing page. Any registered user is then allowed to click a button to answer an ad. 
For each new classified-ad validated a tweet is made on our twitter account

The original poster of the ad still has a right to reject your proposal for whatever reason he or she deems right.

Many more features are in store and should be implemented soon, so stay tuned !
